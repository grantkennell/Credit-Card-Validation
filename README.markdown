#Credit Card Validator#
An Objective-C implementation of the Luhn algorithm, an algorithm that helps to identify fake credit card numbers. Created for the [Square Coding Challenge](http://corner.squareup.com/2011/11/luhny-bin.html)

##Credit Card Company Identifier##
Uses the published credit card to identify many of the common credit card companies such as Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express as the user inputs the number.

##Luhns Algorithm##
This application uses the Luhn algorithm which is able to determine whether a number matches the format of a number issued by a credit card company or if the number is a randomly inputted number. This algorithm reduces the amount of false numbers sent to a credit card processor.

Although I'm only 19, I'm currently taking junior and senior level computer science classes at my university. Next semester I will be taking an independent study with the computer science department head on iOS Security, developing a standard of tests to find applications that make common security mistakes. I come highly recommended by the entire computer science department at Wentworth Institute of Technology, where I'm a freshmen. 

I'm looking for an internship this summer doing iOS Development and I would love to work for Square.
